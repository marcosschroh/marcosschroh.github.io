## Introduction

I was born in General Lamadrid, Buenos Aires Argentina. I am a System Engineer graduated at  National Technological University of La Plata, Argentina. I like technologies, computers, open source, web development, math, statistics and PYTHON!

I am passionate about learning new things and sharing what I know with others. I believe that effort is the key to success. My hobbies are basketball, running and swimming.

## My experience

I worked for 3 years as a Python and Django developer at [Devsar](https://www.devsar.com/), was a really good time. In 2016 I decided to quit my job and travel around Europe. I met really good people and luckily could got a job in the Netherlands. I worked for 1 year for [Telegraaf Media Groep](https://www.tmg.nl/) and currentely I am working for [LeQuest](https://www.lequest.nl/en/)

I expect to continue learning, meeting awesome people, have my company and try to share with you some of the experience that I have. If you have any question, don't hesitate to ask!! :-)
