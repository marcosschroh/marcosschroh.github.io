If you are immerse in the data streaming world, probably you had faced the serialization problem. There are different techniques/frameworks to achieve this, for example [Thrift](https://thrift.apache.org/), [Protocol Buffers](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers) or [Apache Avro](https://avro.apache.org/docs/current/).

Personally, I am using Avro serialization and I always had to came up with avro schemas based on desiered payload keeping in mind fields specification and attributes. This is not a heavy task for simple uses cases, but when we have complex types, data relationships (nested schemas) or custom types the process gets a bit complicated. I asked myself, what if we can generate the avro schemas based on a python class? Most of the time the desired payload that we want get after deserialization is based on a Python class. The ending results was:

[Dataclasses Avro Schema](https://github.com/marcosschroh/dataclasses-avroschema), *Generate Avro Schemas from a Python class* ðŸ˜€

Let's see an example. Suppose that we want an avro schema that represents a User:

```python
{
    "type": "record",
    "name": "User",
    "fields" : [
        {"name": "name", "type": "string"},
        {"name": "age", "type": "int"},
        {"name": "has_pets", "type": "boolean"},
        {"name": "money", "type": "float"}
    ],
    "doc": "User(name: str, age: int, has_pets: bool, money: float)"
}
```

Instead of remember all fields specifications, we can write the python class to get the schema:

```python
from dataclasses_avroschema.schema_generator import SchemaGenerator

class User:
    name: str
    age: int
    has_pets: bool
    money: float

SchemaGenerator(User).avro_schema()

{
  "type": "record",
  "name": "User",
  "fields": [
    {"name": "name", "type": "string"},
    {"name": "age", "type": "int"},
    {"name": "has_pets", "type": "boolean"},
    {"name": "money", "type": "float"}
  ],
  "doc": "User(name: str, age: int, has_pets: bool, money: float)"
}'
```

Super simple and straighforward. We have all this **features**:

* Primitive types: int, long, float, boolean, string and null support
* Complex types: enum, array, map, fixed, unions and records support
* Logical Types: date, time, datetime, uuid support
* Schema relations (oneToOne, oneToMany)
* Recursive Schemas
* Generate Avro Schemas from [faust.Record](https://faust.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference/faust.models.record.html)

So, if you need an avro schema, give a chance to [dataclasses-avroschema](https://github.com/marcosschroh/dataclasses-avroschema) ðŸ˜‰
